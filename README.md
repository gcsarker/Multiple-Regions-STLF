# Data Driven Short-Term Load Forecasting for Multiple Locations: An Integrated Approach

>p> This repository is accompanied with the manuscript titled "Data Driven Short-Term Load Forecasting for Multiple Locations: An Integrated Approach". Our study aims to predict electrical load demand seven days into the future in multiple regions simultaneously. Various Deep Learning (DL) models are utilized for this purpose. The 9 years historical dataset is collected from <a href= "https://pgcb.gov.bd/"> Power Grid Company of Bangladesh </a> website. An easy to understand <a href="https://github.com/gcsarker/Multiple-Regions-STLF/blob/main/multi_region_forecast.ipynb">notebook </a> file is provided to run the system.
